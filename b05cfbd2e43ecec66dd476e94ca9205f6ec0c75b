Comment on taken approach:

It's been decided to just take 2 possible cases:

- if the heads is visible to the user
- of if the tails is visible to the user

and handle them with seemingly duplicated code, with 2 loops. B/c
otherwise, if we just had a single loop it would require us to have
numerous if/else checks in that single loop. Which is way more
complicated to handle etc.
