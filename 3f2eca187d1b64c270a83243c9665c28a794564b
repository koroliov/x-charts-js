Don't follow the mentione decision

It's been decided to abandon the plans to accept JSON as the single
argument to the XCharts and its methods.

The reasons are that:

  - seemingly no one does it, I can't remember a JS library or an npm
    module, which would do it.
  - it potentially would create some performace problems (unlikely, but
    still worth mentioning).
  - another approach to checking properties and their value (based on
    Object.keys(), i.e. checking all present own enumerable properties)
    seems more promising.
