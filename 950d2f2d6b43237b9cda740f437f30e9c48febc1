Angles on slices are inconsistent

 The intention was to have consistent start/end angles on slices, (as
 it's been described many times in different commit messages), but in
 this commit, despite the utils drew everything correctly, the angles
 were inconsistent, e.g. on, say, slice[1] end angle was 5 and on
 slice[2] the end angle was 0.5, because it passed the PI * 2 boundary
 and was reset. This went unnoticed. Fixed in subsequent commit/s.
